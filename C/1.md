## What does 1 word mean?

If we have a 32-**bit** processor, then the processor reads 32/8=4 **bytes** at a time, which means that 1 word is equal to 4 bytes.
If we have a 64-**bit** processor, then the processor reads 64/8=8 **bytes** at a time, which means that 1 word is equal to 8 bytes.

## What is structure padding?

Structure padding means,
the process of adding one or more empty bytes between the different data types to align data in memory. This is done by the compiler itself.

You can try out the below commands in the same directory, to understand better.

```sh
gcc structPadding.c
./a.out
```
